# Babel
Babel is a work in progress package manager for Nimrod.

## Babel's folder structure
Babel stores everything that has been installed in ~/.babel on Unix systems and 
in your $home/babel on Windows. Libraries are installed in lib/ in folders
which names contain the name of the package, the folders
contain the modules and any other files that the package wished to install.
Applications are installed into bin/. There is also a packages/ directory which
contains all the packages' .babel files.

## Contribution

If you have any questions about the project you can ask me directly on github, 
ask on the nimrod [forum](http://force7.de/heimdall), or ask on Freenode in
the #nimrod channel.
