# Babel
Babel is a work in progress package manager for Nimrod.

##Babel's folder structure
Babel stores everything that has been installed in ~/.babel on Unix systems and 
in your $home/babel on Windows. Libraries are installed in lib/ in folders
which names contain both the name and version of the package, the folders
contain the modules and any other files that the package wished to install.

## Contribution

If you have any questions about the project you can ask me directly on github,

the #nimrod channel.
